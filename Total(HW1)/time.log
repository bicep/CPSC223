Major Difficulties faced:
-It was alot more intuitive for me to think about using buffers, so I did that instead. Not very elegant because I have to memset the buffer at the beginning of every loop. Code is also longer. I think that buffer size of 100 should be sufficient.

-Figuring out how to structure the main function took time. Having to get and unget characters also gets confusing.

-Also, long allows me to deal with bigger ints. Still not sure why.

-Getting used to Unix took some time. 

-Still uncertain about how to write a Makefile
