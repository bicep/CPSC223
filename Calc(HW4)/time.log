     Date  Started  Spent Work completed
     ----  -------  ----  --------------
     3/11  12:15pm  2:00  Finished stack implementation. Runs with stacktest well and no valgrind problems.
     3/11  20:00pm  2:00  FInished accepting input
     3/11  22:30pm  1:00  Input is now converted to tokens in stack
     3/12  15:30pm  4:00  Successfully implemented the shunting yard algorithm
     3/13  11:30am  2:00  evaluating RPN, solving valgrind
     3/13  13:30pm  2:00  solving valgrind, also adding float capability
     3/13  17:00pm  0:30  Solved valgrind, decided not to use sprintf
     3/13  18:00pm  3:00  Realized I had to use sprintf. Troubleshooting valgrind errors

     *A brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered*
-VALGRIND is so painful beacause there are so many data structures to keep track of this time.
-Kept getting errors with sprintf
